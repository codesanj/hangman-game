# hangman-game
###  **Introduction**
This game is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. It is implemented in C++ with the use of vectors from the standard library (as to avoid any manual memory management issues). Currently, both the human vs. human mode and the human vs. computer mode are supported.
